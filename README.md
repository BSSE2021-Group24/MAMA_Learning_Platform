1.0	Introduction
Pre-Primary School is a very important stage of all our journeys in Education as it is a place that trains us the little detail that groom us for the Higher Education Levels. This might not be how to Government of Uganda sees it or this stage has been affected greatly by the COVID wave like the rest of the Education stages.

2.0	Background to the Problem
With the closure of kindergarten and nursery schools by the Uganda government [1], there is a need to find a solution to fill in for the missed education opportunity provided by said schools. Such a conclusion is reached as it would be impractical for the nursery students to just sit around at home doing nothing. It would not only stunt their academic growth but also inspire laziness among the children, hence a need for a swift and effective solution.
Besides that, UNICEF-Uganda acknowledges that ‘Early Childhood Development’ (ECD) is key to a full and productive life, and to the progress of a nation. Denying children this education to facilitate this ECD is proven, according to professionals, to deal more harm than good in the long run [2].

3.0	Problem Statement
The problem that this project will be solving is providing a repository of Knowledge for the Pre-Primary School Pupils, since they are level that are being not catered for. Not Only are we bringing a lot of Academic Significance but also introducing them to their Native Culture and Norms at such a tender age which will in turn bring rise to very self-aware and upright Children by the time they are introduced to other teachers of life.

4.0 	Objectives
1.	Main Objective
To develop a system that will be able to teach Nursery children that is as good as the children going to school or even better.

2.	Other Objectives
i.	To teach the younger Generation about Modern Etiquette that is not taught in Pre-Primary.
ii.	To teach the younger Generation about their Native Culture and Norms.
iii.	To provide a solution for Distance Learning for Pre-Primary during the COVID Period [5].

5.0	Methodology
We intend to follow a Qualitative Approach to achieve our Objectives. Specifically, we as a Team shall structure a list of Questions that when answered, would give us a better understanding of how the Pre-primary Learning stage takes place. The technique of the Questionnaire shall be a more cost and time Efficient method to implement than any other technique. Some information would be lost if we only collect data using the Questionnaire because of the nature of Administering the Questions prompts the person to answer only the Question in a summarized way. This will call for us to use a Method that would give us more information. We shall go with the Interview Method which gives us Interviewers the chance to always add a question incase we missed out on when structuring the Questions that would be guiding us.

6.0	Outcomes
The Project will serve as a Knowledge Repository for the Pre-Primary Level.
The Project will give birth of Animated Content that is localized.
The Project will also act as a Tutor of Children following the National Curriculum of Uganda [3].
The Project’s nature will introduce to children Digital Learning at early age which has a number of advantages including making the children more aware of Technology which fastens their adaptation to Technology [4].
The Project will also enable children to learn from home at their convenience [5].
